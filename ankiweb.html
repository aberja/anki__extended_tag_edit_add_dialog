This add-on offers an extended tag editing/adding dialog that shows one tag per line, see the screencast below. You can set different shortcuts for the reviewer (default: "w") and the Add/EditCurrent/Browser window (default: "Alt+Shift+6").

This dialog is especially useful if you have multiple long (hierarchical) tags that don't fit into one line like this one taken from a popular shared deck for med students:

<code>#B&B::Endocrinology::Adrenals::Congenital_Adrenal_Hyperplasia #FirstAid::endo::path::adrenal::cah #Pathoma::15_Endocrine::15.10-15.11-Adrenal_Cortex_&_Adrenal_Medulla Endocrine::Pathology</code>

There's also an extended tag insertion dialog in the Add/EditCurrent/Browser window - you can quickly filter your exisiting tags and insert them into the tag bar at the bottom. The default shortcut for this is "Alt+Shift+5"

<b># known limitations</b>
This add-on only partially works with the add-on <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1496166067" rel="nofollow">night mode</a>: It only works with night mode released on 2020-01-13 or later and night mode doesn't work on the dialog if it's opened from the reviewer.

<b># bugs</b>
Please do not use reviews for bug reports or support requests. I don't get notified of your reviews, and properly troubleshooting an issue through them is nearly impossible (formatting is limited and I can't reply multiple times). If you find a bug let me know on <a href="https://github.com/ijgnd/anki__extended_tag_edit_add_dialog/issues" rel="nofollow">github</a> or on reddit (/u/ijgnord).

<b># Compatibility with other add-ons</b>
The subtag matching from glutanimate's <a href="https://github.com/glutanimate/bettertags-public" rel="nofollow">Bettertags</a> only works if bettertags is loaded before this add-on. E.g. rename the bettertags add-on folder to `1135507716`.
